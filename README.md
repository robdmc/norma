# Norma:  A tool for multivariate normal distributions

This tool provides a conenient interface to the multivariate
normal distribution.  It is very much a work in progress, and not
ready for public consumption.

There is not currently much documentation for norma, but if you want
to play with it, simply import and instantiate the JointNormal class.

```python
from norma.joint_normal import JointNormal
```

The long term vision for Norma includes improving the existing
JointNormal interface as well as implementing a square-root-information
implementation of the Kalman filter.
